Zengine
=======

Eventually this will be a working engine. For now, it's more of an educational project for me, but I'm enjoying it a lot.


TODO:

- ~~Refactor and clean up Client code.~~
- re-implement OpenGL shaders in client.
- add game object and gamestate
- implement server broadcast gamestate


Next goals:
- Client Log-in
- Client input modifies gamestate
- Bounding box collision
