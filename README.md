Zengine
=======

Just finished setting up CMake and Ninja for the build system, "cmake -GNinja" > "ninja" will generate build files, build the project, and place ZengineServer and ZengineClient executables in /bin.

Next up: UDP event based messaging, re-implement OpenGL shaders.

After getting caught up, I'll be implementing Lua scripting.
