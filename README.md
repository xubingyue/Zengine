Zengine
=======

Just finished setting up CMake and Ninja for the build system, "cmake -GNinja" > "ninja" will generate build files, build the project, and place ZengineServer and ZengineClient executables in /bin.

~~Next up: UDP event based messaging~~ DONE but still need to clean up, 
re-implement OpenGL shaders.

After getting caught up, I'll be implementing Lua scripting.

Also really need to clean up the code a bit, will probably get to that before shaders and scripting
